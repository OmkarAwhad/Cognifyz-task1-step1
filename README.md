This task was an exciting opportunity to dive deeper into HTML and CSS, where I designed a functional and user-friendly input form!

    Styled the form elements with a modern design using TailwindCSS.
    Focused on responsiveness with clean margins, padding, and rounded corners.
    Applied minimalistic enhancements to keep the form intuitive and professional.

    Leveraged TailwindCSS utilities for flexbox-based centering and device compatibility.
